    "- 1. A linear relationship is assumed between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n",
    "- 2. Regression residuals must be normally distributed.\n",
    "- 3. The residuals are homoscedastic and approximately rectangular-shaped.\n",
    "- 4. Absence of multicollinearity is expected in the model, meaning that independent variables are not too highly correlated.\n",
    "- 5. No Autocorrelation of the residuals.\n",
